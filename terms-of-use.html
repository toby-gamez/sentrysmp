            <p>
                These Terms of Use govern your use of the services provided on
                the <b>SentrySMP website and the Minecraft server</b>. By
                accessing or using the website and server, you
                <b>agree to be bound by these terms</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>1. General Use</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our services, including any
                    <b>VIP perks and additional items</b> (such as spawn items
                    and keys), are provided as part of a
                    <b>voluntary contribution</b> to support the server
                </li>
                <li>
                    All items purchased or gained through the website or server
                    are for <b>in-game use only</b> and do not constitute
                    real-world transactions
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Purchasing Virtual Items</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Prices listed for in-game items such as keys, ranks, and
                    spawn items (e.g., Skeleton Spawners, Drowned Zombie) are
                    <b>non-refundable</b> unless otherwise stated
                </li>
                <li>
                    By purchasing any items or VIP status, you are making a
                    <b>voluntary contribution</b> to support the server and
                    understand that these items are
                    <b>in-game assets only</b> and cannot be exchanged for
                    real-world currency
                </li>
                <li>
                    Different payment gateways may be available for different
                    products. VIP status can be purchased through either PayPal
                    or Stripe payment systems, as can individual spawners,
                    ranks, and keys. All are considered voluntary contributions
                    to the server's upkeep.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Payment and Contributions</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Payments for items, including spawners, ranks, keys, and VIP
                    status, are processed securely through <b>PayPal</b> and
                    <b>Stripe</b> payment processors. Both payment options are
                    available for all purchase types. You acknowledge that the
                    payment is a <b>donation</b>
                    to the server and not a commercial purchase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    VIP perks and items are purchased separately and represent
                    different types of contributions to the server. VIP status
                    provides enhanced gameplay features while spawners, ranks,
                    and keys are in-game items.
                    <b>VIP status costs 6€</b> and includes all the benefits
                    listed on <a href="vip.html">the VIP page</a> for one month.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may offer occasional special deals or discounts; these
                    offers are subject to availability and may change
                    <b>without prior notice</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    By using our payment systems, you consent to sharing
                    necessary information with our payment processors (PayPal
                    and Stripe) to complete your transaction.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Server Rules and Conduct</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    By accessing the Minecraft server, you
                    <b>agree to follow the server rules</b> and not engage in
                    activities that may harm or disrupt the server experience
                    for others
                </li>
                <li>
                    We reserve the right to <b>ban or suspend</b> users who do
                    not adhere to the server rules
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. VIP Status and Duration</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    VIP status is granted for <b>one month</b> from the date of
                    purchase and your VIP status can be viewed on the
                    <a href="vip-list.php">VIP list page</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    VIP benefits will be automatically applied to your Minecraft
                    account and will expire after one month. This is not a
                    subscription - there is no automatic renewal
                </li>
                <li>
                    VIP status is <b>non-transferable</b> between Minecraft
                    accounts and <b>non-refundable</b> once activated
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the event of a server reset or major update, we will make
                    reasonable efforts to maintain or restore your VIP status
                    for the remainder of your purchased period
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. VIP Permission Management</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We use an automated system to manage VIP permissions when
                    your VIP period expires
                </li>
                <li>
                    This command removes all VIP-related permissions from your
                    account. If you have any other permissions granted through
                    other means, they may also be affected
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you notice any issues with your permissions after VIP
                    expiration, please contact our support team through the
                    <a href="support.html">support page</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We are <b>not liable</b> for any issues arising from the use
                    of the website or server, including but not limited to
                    payment issues, in-game item losses, or server downtimes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While we strive to deliver purchased items and VIP benefits
                    promptly, we will make reasonable efforts to fulfill all
                    purchases.
                </li>
                <li>
